						<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
						<p>A question on self-assessed general health was included in the 2011 Census. The possible responses were 'Very good', 'Good', 'Fair', 'Bad' and 'Very bad'.</p>
						<p>This chart combines the values for 'bad' and 'very bad' and plots these for 18 different ethnicities across six age groups.</p>
						<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
						<p>Use the gender controls to re-plot the data for a specific gender. Highlight specific ethnicities by using the checkboxes, this will bring the selected ethnicity into focus along with revealing the % value with self-assessed bad/very bad health for each age group.</p>
