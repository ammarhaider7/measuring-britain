			<p className="mb-white">Measuring Britain is a project aimed at making official statistics more accessible, interesting and fun through hand-crafted interactive charts and visualisations. We tackle three main areas of social life: Demographics, Health &amp; the Labour Market.</p>
			<p className="mb-white">The first phase of the project takes a fresh look at data from the 2011 census for England &amp; Wales. We'll be adding more visualisations regularly, focusing on more recent data. Sign up in order to be notified when new ones are added.</p>
