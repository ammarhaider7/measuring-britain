						<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
						<p>The top half of the chart shows the composition of the population who are in work while the bottom half shows the same but for people out of work. Instead of displaying individual countries, we have grouped countries into broader geographic areas.</p>
						<p>Regarding employment status, there are two possible values for those in work: <em>Employee</em> and <em>Self-employed</em>. For those out of work, there are six possible values: <em>Unemployed (those actively seeking work)</em>, <em>Retired</em>, <em>Student</em>, <em>Looking after home/family</em>, <em>Long-term sick/disabled</em> and <em>Other</em>.</p>
						<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
						<p>Each shade of colour represents a specific employment status. Hover over the stacked bars to reveal a tooltip that displays the type of employment status along with the % and number of people that fall within it.</p>
