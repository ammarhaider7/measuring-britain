						<p><strong>General Health by Ethnic Group</strong></p>
						<p>A <strong>constrictive</strong> pyramid has fewer people in the younger age categories, perhaps as baby boom populations shift to more conservative birth rates. An <strong>expansive</strong> pyramid represents greater numbers of people in the younger age categories and is typical of where birth rates are high and life expectancy is short. A <strong>stationary</strong> pyramid shows roughly equal numbers of people in all age categories, with a tapering towards the older age categories.</p>
